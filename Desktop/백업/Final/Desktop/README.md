This directory includes naive.c, dtw_cuda.cu, dtw_cuda_shared_N.cu, dtw_cuda_shared_N_padding.cu files, where N indicates the length of time series

### Logs
This directory includes all the logs of different length of time series

### basicTest
This directory includes some basic cuda programming examples (add.cu, hello_world.cu), and a code that measures the maximum length of time series a shared memory can hold (maximum_test.cu), and a code that proves that adjacent words map to adjacent banks (additional_experiment.cu)

### Others
